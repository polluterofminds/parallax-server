  Your summary **must** follow these rules:
  - ✅ Mention the place of the crime.
  - ✅ Mention the victim.
  - ✅ Mention the victim's name.
  - ✅ Mention how the victim was found or died.
  - ❌ Do NOT mention any suspects, motives, or clues.

Example:
Karen stabbed her husband Mark after discovering he had secretly drained their savings to pay off a mistress. She did it in a fit of rage.

The story must be interesting and unique, but not unfathomable.

Rules:

    The motive must be discernable from the crime you create.

    No detectives, investigations, or aftermath.

    Use plain, everyday language.

    Your description of the crime can reveal the culprit, but the culprit SHOULD NOT be found at the scene in any crime scenario you create.
